== more ==
More here: [#navigation:_advanced "navigation: advanced"]

  * Type `view communities` in the [#mechanism:_command_box command box]
  * And that's it: the system shows you the communities available

== join a community ==
  * Type `view communities` in the [#mechanism:_command_box command box]
  * Select a community, to view its details and join, or join directly
  * Voilà: you're in...

  * and the system presents the event creation page to you


= Addendum =

== navigation: advanced ==
If you wish to directly, in one step, for example join a community named _Love on Earth_, you can do the following:
  * type `go into community :Love on earth`

The `:` in the command actually tells the system that `Love on earth` is the parameter for the command `go into community`.

== navigation: advanced ==
