= Navigation =

== mechanism: command box ==
The navigation happens through the command box. You have to ways of entering the command box:
  * by double clicking anywhere except in links
  * by _double clicking_ the Ctrl key (hit the Ctrl key two times, fast...)

Once in the command box, you can type `help` to see the commands available.


== more ==
More here: [#navigation:_advanced "navigation: advanced"]



= Communitites =


== view communities ==
  * Type `view communities` in the [#mechanism:_command_box command box]
  * And that's it: the system shows you the communities available


== join a community ==
  * Type `view communities` in the [#mechanism:_command_box command box]
  * Select a community, to view its details and join, or join directly
  * Voilà: you're in...

*alternative*
  * Type `join community :community_name` in the command box, where _community_name_ is the name of the community you've chosen, as you see it on the page


== go into a community ==
Once you have [#join_a_community "joined a community"] you need to _go into it_ to interact with your fellow members, join events or actions, create events or actions... to go into the community:
  * Type `go into community` in the [#mechanism:_command_box command box]
  * Click on the go into community link of the community
  * Voilà: you're into the community

*alternative*
  * Type `go into community :community_name` in the command box, where _community_name_ is the name of your community



= Events =


== creation ==
Events are always created within a community. The flow:
  * you [#go_into_a_community "go into your community"] if you are not already into a community
  * you type create event in the [#mechanism:_command_box command box]
  * and the system presents the event creation page to you



= Security & _Publicity_ =

== _Publicity_ ==
Except for contact data and messages ([#privacy_contact_details see below]), all the data put into the system is public. Audio, Video, Media...

The data is public and available to all who eventually visit and/or search the site...


== Privacy, Contact details & Messages ==

Your contact details and messages are private (e-mail, phone number, messenger, voip user, address....) in accordance with the privacy laws of your country.

Here, privacy means shared by the members of your community only. Any new member accessing the community only has access to your contact details and messages, after you've raised your veto.

== New membership / Veto-ing ==

_If you do not raise your veto after the member is in: the veto-ing procedure is automatically engaged_.

A new member joins the community through the application.
In case any member believes the person should not come in, the veto-ing procedure applies:

  * The member veto-ing requests a community meeting
  * The member veto-ing explains in front of the community, to the new comer, and only to the new comer why he/she believes the new comer should not come in
  * The new comer decides who of the both should leave. And leaves the next day if he/she decided for him/herself or the veto-er leaves the next day

If there is more than one veto-er, the procedure applies for each one of them.

= Addendum =

== navigation: advanced ==
If you wish to directly, in one step, for example join a community named _Love on Earth_, you can do the following:
  * type `join community :Love on earth`

...and (if all goes well :-)... there might be a page in between), the system is directly making you a member of the community

The `:` in the command actually tells the system that `Love on earth` is the parameter for the command `join community`.


== navigation: advanced ==
The engine uses [http://www.javascript.com javascript] with [http://www.jquery.com Jquery], so you can actually type javascript and/or Jquery code in there...
